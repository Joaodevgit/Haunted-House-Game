## Haunted House Game

### School project developed in Java language for unit course "Data Structures"
Given a map of a haunted house, determine the path that, from the entrance allows the player to reach the outside with the greatest number of life points remaining.
There are 2 game modes **manual** and **simulation**:
- The **manual** game mode asks the user where he wants to go (from the entrance) considering his current location, until he reaches the outside or until he loses all points of life.
- The **simulation** indicates the path that allows the player to reach the outside with the greatest number of points remaining.
